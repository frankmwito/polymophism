# Polymorphism with Duck Typing
# In Python, we can use duck typing to achieve polymorphism. Duck typing is a concept where
# the suitability of an object is determined by the presence of certain methods or properties,
# rather than the actual type of the object. This means that we can write code that works with
# objects of different classes, as long as they have the required methods or properties.
